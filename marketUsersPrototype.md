# Market, Users, Prototype

## Understand Your Market
*Provide links to the 3 websites you explored*   
https://www.airbnb.com/  
https://www.vrbo.com/  
https://www.homestay.com/  


*Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison*   

These websites-airbnb, vrbo, and homestay-are a relevant comparison because they include the ability to rent a home, apartment, or condo temporarily. They also are all booked online and allow users to pick certain dates and locations globally.
    
*List at least 10 product features*   
A user can select an inspired location that gives options based on their vacation goals.  
A user can save, organize, and compare their favorite properties.  
A user can specify if they are looking for a house, condo, apartment, etc.  
A user can filter and specify their needs such as number of rooms, pet friendly, swimming pools, etc.  
A user can view if the host is a super host and the time they have been posting properties on airbnb.  
A user can view and leave reviews that allow insights for future guests to read.   
A user can view the things to do around the area and the distance from the property.    
A user can share a listing to someone else via text, email, etc.   
A user can find other properties in the same area similar to the one they have selected filtered by needs.    
A user can filter their search by available dates in a region.       

## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*   
The user research suggests that the majority of users (38.76%) know what type of vacation they want, but haven't settled on a destination. Very few members, 9.68%, said that they knew the area or country they wanted but haven't chosen a destination. The user interviews had a common pain point that included not being able to recognize the popular destinations and having a lack of information for activities at the location. Also, both users were overwhelmed by the map after clicking the "destinations" tab and felt as though it was difficult to access information on the area around the properties. I think the users wished for more information for the popular destinations, a hover drop down that shows the popular destinations, a short description of each popular location when hovered over, and a better map filtering system such as by their desired vacation type in a region, and then filtered by state.
